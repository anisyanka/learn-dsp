# learn-dsp

### Purpose of this repo
 - Refresh my knoledges of math and apply its in the real world
 - Figure out existed DSP processors and its possibilities
 - Implement several algorithms in Python and in a real hardware

I am going to use VSCode with [jupyter extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) for Python.
And for the hardware one of them:
1. [Cortex-M7 based STM32F7 Discovery board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html) alongside [this guide](https://www.arm.com/resources/education/education-kits/digital-signal-processing).
2. [SHARC Audio Module](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/sharc-audio-module.html)
3. [OMAP featured a variant of the TMS320](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMAP)

### Study plan
 - Start with [this](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/digital-signal-processing) specialization on Coursera
 - Learn the Python scientific computing [ecosystem](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro)
